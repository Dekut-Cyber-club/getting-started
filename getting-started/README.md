```
1.Cybersecurity is NOT easy
2.Cybersecurity requires:
	- Persistence
	- Patience
	- Dedication
	- Lots of reading and researching
	- Lots of practice
    - Eagerness to dig into technical questions and examine them from all sides.
    - Enthusiasm and a high degree of adaptability.
    - An understanding of how systems work.

3.The following skills are essential as far as cybersecurity training is concerned:
    Basic knowledge of operating systems: Since you will work with various operating systems, understanding architecture, and use of operating systems is paramount.
    Knowledge of programming: Understanding programming languages including C/C++, Java or other scripting languages like Python and PHP gives you an added edge over the other security professionals.
    Computer networking basics: Understanding network protocols such as IP Addressing, subnetting, and how they work will help you in natural learning of cybersecurity.
    Web application technologies: A sound exposure in these applications and how they work will be a great asset in helping you learn cybersecurity.
